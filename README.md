The Hysteresis Sensor Integration for Home Assistant provides a customizable sensor that filters input values based on a hysteresis mechanism. Hysteresis is a method used to prevent rapid toggling of a system state by introducing a deadband around a setpoint. This integration allows users to smooth out fluctuations in sensor readings, providing more stable and reliable data for automation and monitoring purposes.
